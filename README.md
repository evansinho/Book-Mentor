# Book-Mentor

> A calendar scheduler application for booking a meeting(call) with a mentor..

## User stories

As a student
I want to book a call with my mentor
So that I can have a mentoring session during my course

[API documentation](https://cfcalendar.docs.apiary.io/)

### Scenario 1:

Given I'm in the calendar page
When I click on a date
Then I see all the time slots containing the available and already allocated call sessions

### Scenario 2:

Given I have chosen a date on the calendar page
When I click on a free time slot
Then I see a field where I type the reason for the call
And I click on the button Confirm Call
Then I see a confirmation message with the date, time, and reason for my call

### Scenario 3:

Given I have chosen a date in the calendar page
When I click on a time slot that has already been allocated to a call Then I see an error message about the allocated slot

### Design Idea

I used the React Big Calendar and populated the event method of the calendar with the mentor API given as slots. Then an onClick event on the slot pops up a modal and with a form that user inputs his/her reason for the call and hit the confirm call buuton and the data is persisted to a database. Now here comes my challenge which is checking if an event is already booked, I wanted to check for an event in the database with the event ID but the events was not coming from my own database so doing that was a bit tricky.

## Built With

- ReactJS
- React Big Calendar
- React-Boostrap
- Node/Express and Mongoose- For persisting booking to a db.
